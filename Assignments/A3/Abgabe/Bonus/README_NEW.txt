Assignment 3 Lukas Nies

Problem 1: 

	- Note: For some reason, my code is pretty slow for the second part of the problem (even though using matrix algebra)
			so please be patient in executing it...
			
	+	Problem_1.1.py: Just execute in editor, performs grid search, outputs parameters with best performance

	+	Problem_1.2.py: Just execute in editor, outputs plot in extra file when finished, prints loop control
						while executing the gradient descent ( For K=3000 takes maybe 10 mins... )
	
	+	Problem_1.3.py: Just execute in editor, outputs plot in extra file when finished, prints loop control
						while executing the stochastic gradient descent ( fast )
						
	+	Problem_1.4.py: Just execute in editor, outputs plot in extra file when finished, prints loop control
						while executing the mini batch stochastic gradient descent ( slower )
						
	+	Problem_1.5.py: Just execute in editor, outputs plot in extra file when finished, prints loop control
						while executing the gradient descent ( fast )

Problem 2:

	+	Problem_2.1.py: Normal features. Just execute in editor, outputs plot in extra file when finished, prints loop control
						while executing the gradient descent ( fast )

	+	Problem_2.2.py: Mapped features. Just execute in editor, outputs plot in extra file when finished, prints loop control
						while executing the gradient descent ( fast )


Problem 3: 

	+	Problem_3.1.py: Just execute in editor, outputs a plot in extra window after finished, prints loop control
						while executing the gradient descent ( slow, maybe 5 mins for 800 iterations)

Problem 4: /

Problem 5:

	- Note: Pretty slow for 60000 features, runtime of about 0(10 min) but yields nice results
	
	+	Problem_5.1.py: Just execute in editor, you can set some parameters like #iterations (K) and #features (k) 
						in main function. Prints loop control in stdout, outputs plot in extra file when finished
